# POMATWO

POMATWO is an electricity market model designed to minimize system costs by
determining the optimal electricity supply on an hourly basis. 
It incorporates market clearing conditions, country-specific merit order curves, 
grid topology, and network constraints. Using a multi-step approach, POMATWO can 
simulate both the day-ahead market and multiple intraday market gates.
Within the iDesignRES framework, POMATWO is used to calculate the cost-optimal
utilization of generation capacities.
