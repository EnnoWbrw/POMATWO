# Market Types

POMATWO supports different market types, defined as subtypes of the abstract type `MarketType`.  
The market type specifies whether a zonal or nodal market design is used.
Choosing the appropriate type is essential for model construction and simulation behavior.

## Zonal Markets

Zonal markets are coarse representations of the power system, where nodes are aggregated into zones, and cross-border flows are modeled via exchange formulations.

```@docs
ZonalMarket
```

## Nodal Markets

Nodal markets use detailed grid representations with nodal-level price formation and physical power flows.

```@docs
NodalMarket
```

## Exchange Formulations

Exchange formulations define how power exchanges between zones are handled in zonal market settings.

```@docs
NTC
```

## Load Flow Formulations

Load flow formulations are used in nodal market and redispatch settings to model physical power flows under DC approximations.

# Redispatch Setup

POMATWO supports optional redispatch modeling. Redispatch is activated via types derived from `RedispatchSetup`.

# Market States

Market simulations in POMATWO can consist of multiple stages (or states), such as day-ahead market, redispatch, and prosumer optimization.

# Prosumer Setup

Due to the increasing penetration of decentralized generation, especially rooftop PV, POMATWO includes the ability to model prosumersâ€”entities that both consume and produce electricity.  
Prosumers can be passive or actively optimize their market behavior depending on price signals and tariff schemes.
